# NotifyAOD

<img src="https://github.com/bebras123/notifyaod/blob/main/docs/screenshot.png" width="300" height="800">

**NotifyAOD** is an Android utility that automatically turns **Always-On Display (AOD)** on or off
depending on incoming notifications.

This app is useful if there is no such option on your device.
This app just turns on/off your devices' AOD, it does not provide AOD functionality itself.
This app does not modify how AOD looks.

When you receive a notification:

- The app **enables AOD** so you can see it immediately on your lock screen.
- When all notifications are cleared, the app **disables AOD**.

By default all notifications will enable AOD.

You decide which apps are considered important and whether to use **whitelist mode**:

- In **whitelist mode**, **only** notifications from selected apps enable AOD.
- In normal mode (whitelist off), all notifications from **non-listed** apps will trigger AOD.
